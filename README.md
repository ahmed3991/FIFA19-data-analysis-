# FIFA19-data-analysis- 
My goal for this project is to learn/improve essential data analysis skills while also gaining a better understanding of FIFA value and wage rules. I'm using this dataset as a proxy for real-world data to determine whether it's worthwhile to invest significant time and effort in acquiring real-world data.
